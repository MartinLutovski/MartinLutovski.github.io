        Write a JavaScript program to display the reading status of some book.
        The object should have the next properties: title, author, readingStatus
        and a method that will return info depending on the readingStatus e.g.

        need to read 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games' by Suzanne
        Collins. (if false). Bonus: enter the values from prompt().
